# Satrix ETF comparison tool
This repository hosts a python project for comparing ETF products from Satrix Investments (https://www.satrix.co.za/products)

1. The first step is to get data on all of Satrix products. There are various ways of doing this - downloading MDDs and then extracting data from the MDDs or extracting data by scraping the product pages. Both ways will be approached and investigated. There is also need for constantly updating these data so whichever approach is the most efficient for initial population and subsequent periodic updates will be utilised. 
2. The second step is to determine and define metrics best suited to reflect different investment philosophies by combining and manipulating the fund metrics that are extracted from the fund information documentation.
3. Defined metrics can then be used to aid in ETF decision making and/or ETF comparisons.
